# Managing Performance

## JavaScript Async/Await vs Promises

Node now supports async/await out of the box since version 7.6. Note however version 7.6 has no LTS. Version 8 does

Async/await is one of the most revolutionary features that have been added to JavaScript. It makes you realize what a syntactical mess promises are, and provides an intuitive replacement.

1. Async/await is a new way to write asynchronous code. Previous options for asynchronous code are callbacks and promises.

2. Async/await is actually built on top of promises. It cannot be used with plain callbacks or node callbacks.

3. Async/await is, like promises, non blocking.

4. Async/await makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code. This is where all its power lies.

## Syntax

Assuming a function getJSON that returns a promise, and that promise resolves with some JSON object. We just want to call it and log that JSON, then return "done".
This is how you would implement it using promises:

```
const makeRequest = () =>
  getJSON()
    .then(data => {
      console.log(data)
      return "done"
    })

makeRequest();

```

And this is how it looks with async/await:

```
const makeRequest = async () => {
  console.log(await getJSON())
  return "done"
}

makeRequest();

```

 await getJSON() means that the console.log call will wait until getJSON() promise resolves and print it value.


Note there are a few differences here:

1. Our function has the keyword async before it. The await keyword can only be used inside functions defined with async. 

2. Any async function returns a promise implicitly, and the resolve value of the promise will be whatever you return from the function (which is the string "done" in our case).

3. The above point implies that we can’t use await in the top level of our code since that is not inside an async function.


### Why use ASYNC/WAIT


1. Concise and clean
Look at how much code we didn’t write! Even in the contrived example above, it’s clear we saved a decent amount of code. We didn’t have to write .then, create an anonymous function to handle the response, or give a name data to a variable that we don’t need to use. We also avoided nesting our code. These small advantages add up quickly, which will become more obvious in the following code examples.

2. Error handling

Async/await makes it finally possible to handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors with the same construct, good old try/catch. In the example below with promises, the try/catch will not handle if JSON.parse fails because it’s happening inside a promise. We need to call .catch on the promise and duplicate our error handling code, which will (hopefully) be more sophisticated than console.log in your production ready code.

```
const makeRequest = () => {
  try {
    getJSON()
      .then(result => {
        // this parse may fail
        const data = JSON.parse(result)
        console.log(data)
      })
      // uncomment this block to handle asynchronous errors
      // .catch((err) => {
      //   console.log(err)
      // })
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```

Now look at the same code with async/await. The catch block now will handle parsing errors.

,,,
const makeRequest = async () => {
  try {
    // this parse may fail
    const data = JSON.parse(await getJSON())
    console.log(data)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
  }
}

```

3. Conditionals

Imagine something like the code below which fetches some data and decides whether it should return that or get more details based on some value in the data.

```
const makeRequest = () => {
  return getJSON()
    .then(data => {
      if (data.needsAnotherRequest) {
        return makeAnotherRequest(data)
          .then(moreData => {
            console.log(moreData)
            return moreData
          })
      } else {
        console.log(data)
        return data
      }
    })
}

```

Just looking at this gives you a headache. It’s easy to get lost in all that nesting (6 levels), braces, and return statements that are only needed to propagate the final result up to the main promise.

This example becomes way more readable when rewritten with async/await.

```
const makeRequest = async () => {
  const data = await getJSON();
  if (data.needsAnotherRequest) {
    const moreData = await makeAnotherRequest(data);
    console.log(moreData)
    return moreData
  } else {
    console.log(data)
    return data    
  }
}
```

4. Intermediate values

You have probably found yourself in a situation where you call a promise1 and then use what it returns to call promise2, then use the results of both promises to call a promise3. Your code most likely looked like this:

```
const makeRequest = () => {
  return promise1()
    .then(value1 => {
      // do something
      return promise2(value1)
        .then(value2 => {
          // do something          
          return promise3(value1, value2)
        })
    })
}
```

You could still flatten and  wrap both values 1 & 2 in a Promise.all() and avoid deeper nesting. Promose.all() receives an array of dependencies. Like this: 

```
const makeRequest = () => {
  return promise1()
    .then(value1 => {
      // do something
      return Promise.all([value1, promise2(value1)])
    })
    .then(([value1, value2]) => {
      // do something          
      return promise3(value1, value2)
    })
}
```

This same logic becomes ridiculously simple and intuitive with async/await. It makes you wonder about all the things you could have done in the time that you spent struggling to make promises look less hideous.

```
const makeRequest = async () => {
  const value1 = await promise1()
  const value2 = await promise2(value1)
  return promise3(value1, value2)
}
```

5. Error stacks

Imagine a piece of code that calls multiple promises in a chain, and somewhere down the chain an error is thrown.

```
const makeRequest = () => {
  return callAPromise()
    .then(() => callAPromise())
    .then(() => callAPromise())
    .then(() => callAPromise())
    .then(() => callAPromise())
    .then(() => {
      throw new Error("oops");
    })
}

makeRequest()
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
    // output
    // Error: oops at callAPromise.then.then.then.then.then (index.js:8:13)
  })
  ```

The error stack returned from a promise chain gives no clue of where the error happened. Even worse, it’s misleading; the only function name it contains is callAPromise which is totally innocent of this error (the file and line number are still useful though).

However, the error stack from async/await points to the function that contains the error


```
const makeRequest = async () => {
  await callAPromise()
  await callAPromise()
  await callAPromise()
  await callAPromise()
  await callAPromise()
  throw new Error("oops");
}

makeRequest()
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
    // output
    // Error: oops at makeRequest (index.js:7:9)
  })
```

This is not a huge plus when you’re developing on your local environment and have the file open in an editor, but it’s quite useful when you’re trying to make sense of error logs coming from your production server. In such cases, knowing the error happened in makeRequest is better than knowing that the error came from a then after a then after a then …

6. Debugging

Last but not least, a killer advantage when using async/await is that, it’s much easier to debug. Debugging promises has always been such a pain for 2 reasons: 

i. You can’t set breakpoints in arrow functions that return expressions (no body).

```
const makeRequest = () => {
	
	return callApromise ()
	.then( () => callApromise() )
	.then( () => callApromise() )
	.then( () => callApromise() )
	.then( () => callApromise() )
}
```

ii. If you set a breakpoint inside a .then block and use debug shortcuts like step-over, the debugger will not move to the the following .then because it only “steps” through synchronous code.

With async/await you don’t need arrow functions as much, and you can step through await calls exactly as if they were normal synchronous calls.

```
const makeRequest = async () => {
	await callApromise()
	await callApromise()
	await callApromise()
	await callApromise()
}

```
