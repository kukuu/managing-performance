# Managing Performance in Digital Transformation

Is the change associated with the application of digital technology. When planning for digital transformation, organizations must factor the cultural changes they'll confront as workers and organizational leaders adjust to adopting and relying on unfamiliar technologies. Practices used in transformation include methodologies like Agile, Continuous Delivery, Micro-services and Containerization.

The advancement of platform computing environments like NodeJS has allowed JavaScript to be deployed from the back end which has changed the eco-system of the technologies implementation as an isomorphic tool. 

with the avalanche of smart devices, and  increased bandwidth associated with them,  JavaScript is now a de-facto and by default activated on nearly all browsers depoyed in  digital  devices.  Though best practise is still to test your applications built with JavaScript first enabled, and then disabled. Core functionality should be maintained when JavaScript is disabled (you may have to provide alternate solution or data store strategies for core functionality without JavaScript), and the rendering of your pages should degrade gracefully. 

JavaScript performance will continue to be an important part of each browser's competitive advantage.
